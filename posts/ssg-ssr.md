title: When to use Static Generation vs Server Side Rendering in your pages? 
date: '2021-07-28'
---

Static Generation is recommended by default with/without data to fetch in your pages. 

Examples: 
- Blogs 
- Marketing pages 
- E-commerce product listings 
- Help and documentation 

If the pages do not change easily and remain the same for most of the requests then static generation is recommended. 

If the pages change with each request, then server side rendering is recommended.
